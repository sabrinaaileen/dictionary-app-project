# 📚 React Dictionary App

This is a dictionary web app built with React — it allows users to search for words and get detailed results including definitions, examples, synonyms, and related images.

🌐 [Live Demo](https://react-dictionaryapp-project.netlify.app)

---

## ✨ Features

- **Word search** with instant result updates
- **Definitions** grouped by part of speech
- **Example sentences** for context
- **Synonyms** to expand vocabulary
- **Image search** based on keyword (via SheCodes Images API)

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- React.js  
- HTML5 & CSS3  
- SheCodes Dictionary API  
- SheCodes Images API  
- Netlify (hosting & deployment)

---

## 🎯 Purpose

I created this project as part of a SheCodes React course to practice working with **APIs, dynamic data rendering, and component-based design** in React.  
It helped me understand how to manage asynchronous requests and conditionally display content in a clean, user-friendly way.

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to use external APIs in React  
- State management and conditional rendering  
- Styling with CSS and structuring responsive layouts  
- Creating reusable components  
- Handling undefined or empty API results gracefully

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
